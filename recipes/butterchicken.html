    <p>Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, you may notice that Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani — chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala.
        Prepared in a buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. Most restaurants are known to add in copious amounts of butter, which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick of grease.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>350 grams boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup onions minced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup tomato pureed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canned tomato paste or sauce</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp butter or ghee</li>

    <p>Indian food is normally associated with dishes like Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka, ‘Naan Bread’, and Biryani. Having a good butter chicken recipe in your repertoire is not a bad idea, especially if you plan to entertain a mixed group of Indians and non-Indians and want a crowd-pleaser.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Heat the butter in a pan and add the minced onions. Fry until golden brown</li>
        <li>Add the ginger, garlic, coriander powder, chilli powder, turmeric, and salt. </li>
        <li>Fry for a minute until fragrant</li>
        <li>Add the pureed tomato and tomato paste and cook for 3-4 mins until the mixture bubbles uniformly</li>
        <li>Add in the kasuri methi, milk, and the cubed chicken along with some salt</li>
        <li>Cook covered for 8-10 mins until the chicken is soft. The chicken will let out more water, just check once or twice in between and give the curry a stir. Keep the heat on low</li>
        <li>When the chicken is cooked soft, open the lid and cook for a further minute or two. If the gravy is too thick, add some water at this stage</li>
        <li>When done, add the garam masala and the cream or cashew paste. Give it a good stir, but don't boil</li>
        <li>Adjust salt, garnish with the coriander leaves, and remove from heat</li>
        <li>Serve hot with tawa naan, vegetable pulao, or jeera rice</li>
    </ol>
